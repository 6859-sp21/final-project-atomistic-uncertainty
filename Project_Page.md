## Abstract
Academic work is often communicated through peer-reviewed research papers, conference presentations and occasional media coverage. While these formats allow for a full or partial understanding of the results, they are often limited in availability or require considerable effort to be read by an expert  outside of the field. In this work, we use an interactive visualization to summarize the main insights from a research paper. As an example, we focus on a recent paper addressing uncertainty quantification in materials simulation. To address the known difficulties of representing uncertainty in high-dimensional spaces, we use a scrollytelling narrative to gradually build the concepts of the paper. In this framework, dynamic images allow the viewer to interact with data not readily available in the article, thus improving the reading experience. We qualitatively validate our approach by showing the visualizations to experts and non-experts in the field. Viewers exposed to the simplified approach report a higher curiosity towards the research results regardless of their level of expertise. Moreover, expert viewers report that this interactive article could greatly help their understanding of new research articles. We believe that interactive visualizations can increase the exposure of academic articles communicate their results more efficiently both to experts and non-experts.
